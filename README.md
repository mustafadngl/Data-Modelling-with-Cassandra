# Cassandra-Basic-Data-Modelling-Template
This repository provides fresh start with data modelling from first project in udacity nanodegree program. 
In `Project_Template.ipynb` folder every step explained in docstring. In order to process locally, all folders paths should be stated in same folder. 
Also data file should be unzipped. In order to avoid errors, image file contains all [images](https://github.com/mustafathemech/Cassandra-Basic-Data-Modelling-Template-via_udacity-/tree/main/images) which are explained in template.
Project is a cassandra database based on project in order to apply ETL processes via a cluster. 
Also, shows upright understanding on industrial concepts of data implementation.

## Project Outline
Project consists two part. In the first part, event database implemented in the [jupyter](https://github.com/mustafathemech/Cassandra-Basic-Data-Modelling-Template-via_udacity-/blob/main/Project_Template.ipynb) and created [event_datafile_new.csv](https://github.com/mustafathemech/Cassandra-Basic-Data-Modelling-Template-via_udacity-/blob/main/event_datafile_new.csv) file from random data files in order to extract into cassandra cluster. In the second part, cassandra cluster setup implemented and for basic OLAP questions queries passed in cluster in cassandra. 

## Requirements and Application
This project requires Jupyter Notebook. Collect all the documents in same directory and unzip [event_data.zip](https://github.com/mustafathemech/Cassandra-Basic-Data-Modelling-Template-via_udacity-/blob/main/event_data.zip). After that, all steps can be followed in [jupyter](https://github.com/mustafathemech/Cassandra-Basic-Data-Modelling-Template-via_udacity-/blob/main/Project_Template.ipynb).
